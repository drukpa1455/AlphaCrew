  - *Integrated Reporting & Monitoring:*  
    All high-level outputs, performance metrics, and interim reports are automatically visualized in Grafana dashboards, with underlying metrics stored in Prometheus. Real-time notifications and interactive commands are delivered via Slack, ensuring that human oversight is fully integrated into the workflow.

- **Trade Execution & Human Oversight:**  
  - *Execution Trade Agent & Alpaca API:*  
    The Execution Trade Agent compiles trade recommendations based on aggregated investment memorandums and prevailing market conditions. These recommendations are routed via Slack to the Portfolio Manager, who reviews, requests further details if needed, and authorizes trades through a direct connection to Alpaca's Python API.  
  - *Grafana for Investment Monitoring:*  
    Comprehensive investment memorandums, compliance reports, and real-time performance metrics are maintained in Grafana dashboards, providing a dynamic, accessible visualization platform for oversight and decision-making.
